## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style
- **Semicolons**: Always use semicolons at the end of statements
- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces (no tabs)
- **Variable Naming**: Use camelCase for variables and functions
  ```javascript
  // ‚úÖ Good
  const boxHeight = 1;
  const originalBoxSize = 3;
  function createRingEffect(x, y, z) { }
  
  // ‚ùå Avoid
  const box_height = 1;
  const OriginalBoxSize = 3;
  function create_ring_effect(x, y, z) { }
  ```
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
  ```javascript
  const MAX_STACK_HEIGHT = 100;
  const DEFAULT_CAMERA_POSITION = { x: 3, y: 3, z: 3 };
  ```
- **Function Declarations**: Use function declarations for main functions, arrow functions for callbacks
  ```javascript
  // ‚úÖ Main functions
  function addLayer(x, z, width, depth, direction) { }
  
  // ‚úÖ Callbacks and short functions
  const animate = () => { };
  overhangs.forEach((element) => { });
  ```

### CSS Style
- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces
- **Property Order**: Group related properties together
- **Colors**: Use hex values for colors, prefer lowercase
- **Selectors**: Use kebab-case for class names
  ```css
  /* ‚úÖ Good */
  .game-container {
    position: absolute;
    top: 10px;
    left: 50%;
    color: #ffffff;
  }
  
  /* ‚ùå Avoid */
  .gameContainer {
    color: WHITE;
    top: 10px;
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
  }
  ```

### HTML Style
- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces
- **Attributes**: Use double quotes
- **IDs and Classes**: Use kebab-case
- **Semantic Elements**: Use appropriate semantic HTML elements
